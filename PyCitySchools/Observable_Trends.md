# Observable Trends

* Does an increase in spending per student have an impact on the average Math and Reading test scores? (Scores by School Spending)

--One would expect to observe that as "Spending per Student" increased, the average test scores would increase.
--This data does NOT seem to support this. In fact, we see that as spending per student increases, there are sharp declines in average test scores for both math and reading.

* Does school size impact the average Math and Reading test scores? (Scores by School Size)
--There does appear to be a correlation between school size and students' performances on their math and reading test.
--Data indicates as schools size increases, average test scores for both math and reading decline.
--Additionally, smaller and medium sized schools appeared to have a significantly higher overall pass rate when compared to large schools.
--Perhaps this can be explained by smaller class sizes, and the instructors' abilty to have more one on one time with each student.

* Which scools performed better, Charter Schools or District Schools? (Scores by School Type)
--Charter schools outperformed district schools in both math and reading, and Charter schools significantly outperformed district schools in terms of their students overall pass rate.
